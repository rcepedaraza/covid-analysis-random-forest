# covid-analysis-random-forest

This case study was designed to drive home the important role that data science plays in real-world situations like this pandemic. This case study uses **Random Forest Classifier** and a dataset from the _South Korean_ cases of COVID-19 provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset) to encourage research on this important topic. The goal of the case study is to build a Random Forest Classifier to predict the "state" of the patient.
